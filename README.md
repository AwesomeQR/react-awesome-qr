## Getting started

```bash
yarn add @awesomeqr/react
# OR using npm
npm install --save @awesomeqr/react
```

```tsx
import { AwesomeQRCode, AwesomeQRCodeProps, AwesomeQRCodeState } from "@awesomeqr/react"

const props: AwesomeQRCodeProps = {
    text: "Hello AwesomeQR",
    ...
    onStateChange: (state: AwesomeQRCodeState) => {
        switch (state) {
            case 'working':
                // ...
                break
            case 'idle':
                // ...
                break
        }
    }
}

...

<AwesomeQRCode {...props} />
```

## Configuration

_AwesomeQRCodeProps_ contains the properties from _Options_ as defined in [Options: Awesome-qr.js](https://github.com/SumiMakito/Awesome-qr.js/blob/master/README.md#options) and a few exclusive properties owned by this component.

### onStateChange

```ts
((state: AwesomeQRCodeState) => void)?
                         â†– 'working' | 'idle'
```

Setting up a state changes listener to know when the core is working or idle.
